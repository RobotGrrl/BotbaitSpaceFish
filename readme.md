One of the ways Botbait enjoys spending its time is by playing with fish (of course)! These fish live in a special habitat... SPACE! They float around the cosmic-coloured waves and go wherever the 'water' current directs them. 

Botbait keeps an eye out for when there are four or more fish near its tail. When there is, it will swoosh its tail to disturb them. The fish swim away, but eventually make their way back. If one of Botbait's buttons are pressed, then it will gently swish its tail.
